## üéØ What It Does

Right-click on an image file (BMP, GIF, JPG, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, WEBP) and choose **"Set as Folder Icon"**.  
This script will:

- Convert the image into a `.ico` file using [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/),
- Write a `desktop.ini` file with the necessary icon settings,
- Set the folder‚Äôs attributes so Windows recognizes the icon.

The change is visible in File Explorer (you may need to refresh or reopen the window).

---

## üß© Requirements

- **Windows 10 or 11**
- **PowerShell** (built-in)
- **ImageMagick** installed and available in your system's `PATH`

### üõ† Installing ImageMagick

You can download ImageMagick from their website:  
üëâ [imagemagick.org/script/download.php#windows](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php#windows)

Or install it from a terminal with one of these (admin rights may be needed):

```shell
winget install ImageMagick.Q16-HDRI
scoop install main/imagemagick
choco install imagemagick
```

To verify it‚Äôs working, try this:

```shell
Copy
Edit
magick logo: logo.gif
magick identify logo.gif
```

## üöÄ Setup

1. **Download this folder** and place it somewhere safe on your computer;

2. **Right-click** `setup_context_menu.ps1` and select **Run With PowerShell** (might require administrative rights)  
    This registers the context menu for supported image types.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> üîÅ You can move the folder later, but you‚Äôll need to re-run `setup_context_menu.ps1` if you do.  
> This is because the right-click menu points to the script‚Äôs current location.

---

## ‚úÖ Usage

- Right-click an image ‚Üí choose **Set as Folder Icon**.

- The icon file (`icon.ico`) and configuration (`desktop.ini`) are saved in the same folder as the image.

That‚Äôs it! Your folder will now show the custom icon.

### ‚ùå To Remove a Folder Icon

Just delete the `icon.ico` or `desktop.ini` file from the folder.

### üîß To Uninstall the Context Menu

Right-click `uninstall_context_menu.ps1` ‚Üí **Run With PowerShell** (might require administrative rights).

### üìÅ What Happens Internally?

- `magick` converts the image to `icon.ico` using multi-resolution settings (64, 128, 256).

- A `desktop.ini` file is written with the following contents:
  
  ini
  
  CopyEdit
  
  `[.ShellClassInfo] IconResource=icon.ico,0`

- The script marks the folder with `+s +r` attributes so that Windows uses the `.ini` file.

- The icon and `.ini` are marked as hidden/system files so they don't clutter the view.

### üß† Existing Files?

If `icon.ico` or `desktop.ini` already exists, they will be overwritten without prompting.  
This avoids clutter and ensures a clean overwrite.

### üí° Icon Not Updating?

Windows sometimes caches folder icons aggressively. If your new icon doesn‚Äôt appear immediately, try one of these:

- Press `F5` to refresh the folder.

- Close and reopen File Explorer.

- Reboot your system

Still not working and can't wait for a reboot?

> [!WARNING]
> 
> **Run the included** `reset_explorer_icon_cache.ps1`  
> *(Right-click ‚Üí Run with PowerShell)*

This will:

- Close all File Explorer windows

- Delete Windows‚Äô icon cache

- Restart Explorer automatically

**‚ö† Make sure to save any open work** ‚Äî this will temporarily shut down Explorer.
